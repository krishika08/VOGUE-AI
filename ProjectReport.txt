                        SMART CLOTHING RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
                            Technical Project Report
================================================================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
The Smart Clothing Recommendation System is a Machine Learning-powered application 
designed to solve the "What should I wear?" dilemma. It personalizes outfit 
suggestions by analyzing three critical factors:
   a) Real-time Weather Conditions (Live API Data)
   b) Event Context (User Input)
   c) Skin Tone Color Theory (Aesthetic Rules)

2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
----------------------
The system is built using Python and consists of four main modules:

[A] Data Generation Module:
    - Since no public dataset existed for this specific problem, a synthetic 
      dataset of 5,000 entries was generated.
    - It maps weather/event combinations to appropriate outfits (e.g., 
      "Hot" + "Gym" -> "Sleeveless Tank").

[B] Machine Learning Engine (The Brain):
    - Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier (Scikit-Learn).
    - Training: The model was trained on the synthetic dataset to learn patterns.
    - Accuracy: Achieved >95% accuracy on test data.
    - Persistence: The model is saved as a .pkl file to provide instant predictions.

[C] Weather Integration (The Eyes):
    - API: Open-Meteo API.
    - Function: Fetches real-time temperature and weather codes for any city.
    - Logic: Categorizes raw temperature into "Hot", "Moderate", or "Cold".

[D] Application Interface (The Face):
    - Framework: Streamlit.
    - Features: Interactive sidebar, real-time data fetching, and dynamic 
      color palette visualization.

3. HOW IT WORKS
---------------
1. User Inputs: City (e.g., "London"), Event (e.g., "Party"), Skin Tone.
2. Data Processing: 
   - The system queries the Weather API for the city's current status.
   - Input text is encoded into numbers using LabelEncoders.
3. Prediction: The ML model predicts the most suitable outfit category.
4. Color Theory: A rule-based logic engine suggests the best matching colors.
5. Output: The user sees a dashboard with the outfit, current temperature, 
   and a visual color guide.

4. FUTURE SCOPE
---------------
- Integration of Computer Vision to let users virtually "try on" clothes.
- Connecting to e-commerce links (Amazon/Myntra) to buy the recommended outfits.
- Expanding the dataset to include body types and seasonal fashion trends.
